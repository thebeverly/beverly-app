CONTRIBUTIONS & THANKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Thanks to Nicolas Robidoux for his help during madVR scaling
 development, and for introducing the concept of doing linear 1-pass
 2D Jinc resampling.

 Thanks to tritical for creating NNEDI3 and for allowing me to use
 the GPL weights in madVR:

 Thanks to SEt for creating a well optimized OpenCL NNEDI3 kernel,
 and for making it available under LGPL, so I could use it in madVR:

 Thanks to Shiandow for his dithering ideas (e.g. gamma correction),
 and for his various HLSL algorithms, including NEDI, Super(Chroma)Res,
 Bilateral chroma upscaling and SSIM downscaling:

 Thanks to Didée once more, for many good ideas in various of his
 AviSynth scripts, which I've partially used for the "sharpen edges",
 "crispen edges" and "enhance detail" algorithms.

 Thanks to CeeJay.dk for porting the LumaSharpen script to a video
 player compatible format:
